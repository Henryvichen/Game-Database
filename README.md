# Game Database

This application is a gaming database made using Angular and RAWG's extensive video games database as the source for data. [RAWG](https://rapidapi.com/accujazz/api/rawg-video-games-database/details)

In this app you can search for specific video games, or use the sort button to find a video game with a sorting method of your choice.
Once a game is selected, the app will display information about the game including release date, metacritic rating, and screenshots/trailers.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
